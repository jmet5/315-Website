	<p>Hi, my name is Jacob Metcalf and I am a junior Computer Science major from Frisco, TX also pursuing a minor in cybersecurity. I am the oldest of 4 boys and I enjoy spending time
with my family. I enjoy watching all sports, mostly soccer, football, and basketball. I am a huge fan of the Chicago Bears. My favorite TV show is Breaking Bad and my favorite
movie series is Star Wars. In my free time, I like to spend time with my friends. I am involved in a men's organization on campus called Professional Brotherhood of Engineers (PBE) 
where I help to plan events and help younger members with their coursework. Find out more about PBE <a href="https://www.tamupbe.com/">here</a>. I have enjoyed my time at A&M 
and I am looking forward to interning with Texas Instruments in the Summer of 2020. Links to social media: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jacob.metcalf.14">Facebook</a>
