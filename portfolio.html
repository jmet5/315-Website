<p>When it came to deciding what I wanted my major to be in college, I always knew I wanted to work with technology. After taking a computer science class in high school, 
I knew it was something I enjoyed. Computer science really interested me at first because of the many career paths it offers along with its everlasting impact on society. 
Throughout my time in computer science at Texas A&M, I have been able to work on many interesting projects. Some of these projects include, creating a maze game in C++, building 
a processor in Logisim, creating a GUI in java, and making a buddy system memory allocator in C++. A few of the courses I have taken include data structures and 
<a href="http://news.mit.edu/2020/virginia-williams-professor-0107">algorithms</a>, programming languages, and computer organization. I am grateful for the foundation 
in computer science that A&M has given me in order to succeed in my career. After starting my junior year, I really switched my focus to searching for an internship to begin my 
technical career. It peaked my interest to be able to apply the knowledge Iâ€™ve gained from class in a corporate environment. While going through the application process, I found 
the most difficult part of applying for a computer science position to be the technical interviews. During preparation, I was able to find some excellent resources such 
as <a href="https://leetcode.com/">leetcode</a> and the Cracking the Coding Interview <a href="http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/">book</a>. As diverse as computer science 
is, the fields that interest me the most are data analytics, software development, and cybersecurity. Although most people view computer scientists as programming all day on the 
job, that is not the case with many positions. <a href="https://www.masterstudies.com/article/how-data-analytics-is-transforming-the-working-world/">Data analytics</a> is an 
interesting track to me because of the interaction between computer science and business. Nowadays, data drives big businesses in every industry. Another field that I would like 
to contribute to in the future is <a href="https://www.forcepoint.com/cyber-edu/cybersecurity">cybersecurity</a> because of how essential security is to every company that deals with 
confidential customer information. Overall, I am eager to begin my career and impact the lives of thousands of people through computer science. For additional information about me,
